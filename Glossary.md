A

- **Active Directory (AD):** A directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services.

B

- **BitLocker:** A full disk encryption feature included with Microsoft Windows versions starting with Windows Vista. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes.

C

- **Checkpoint:** A saved state of a virtual machine (VM) at a specific point in time. It allows you to revert the VM to that state if needed.
- **Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV):** A feature of Windows Server Failover Clustering that allows multiple nodes to simultaneously access the same NTFS-formatted volume.

D

- **Dynamic Memory:** A Hyper-V feature that allows the amount of memory allocated to a VM to be adjusted automatically based on its needs.

F

- **Failover Clustering:** A feature that provides high availability and scalability by grouping multiple servers together to work as a single system.

H

- **Host Guardian Service (HGS):** A server role introduced in Windows Server 2016 to help protect shielded VMs by ensuring that they run only on known, trusted hosts.
- **Hyper-V:** A native hypervisor developed by Microsoft that allows you to create and manage virtual machines.

I

- **Integration Services:** A set of utilities in Hyper-V that improve the integration between the physical computer (host) and the virtual machine (guest).

L

- **Live Migration:** A feature in Hyper-V that allows you to move running virtual machines from one physical host to another with no downtime.

M

- **Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter (MVMC):** A tool provided by Microsoft to convert VMware VMs to Hyper-V VMs.

N

- **Nested Virtualization:** A feature that allows you to run Hyper-V inside a virtual machine.

P

- **PowerShell:** A task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language.
- **Private Virtual Switch:** A type of virtual switch in Hyper-V that allows communication only between virtual machines on the same host.

R

- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.
- **Replica:** A feature in Hyper-V that replicates VMs from one Hyper-V host to another for disaster recovery purposes.

S

- **Secure Boot:** A security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).
- **Shielded VM:** A type of virtual machine in Hyper-V that uses BitLocker encryption and other technologies to protect against unauthorized access and tampering.
- **System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM):** A management solution for the virtualized datacenter, enabling centralized management of Hyper-V, VMware, and Citrix XenServer environments.

V

- **Virtual Hard Disk (VHD):** A disk image file format for storing the complete contents of a hard drive. VHDs can be used as the storage medium for virtual machines in Hyper-V.
- **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN):** A logical subgroup within a local area network that combines devices from multiple physical LANs into a single logical network.
- **Virtual Machine (VM):** A software emulation of a physical computer, running an operating system and applications just like a physical computer.

W

- **Windows Admin Center:** A web-based management tool for Windows Server and Hyper-V, providing a unified interface for managing servers, clusters, and Hyper-V hosts.
